**Linear quadratic regulator** <br />
We consider

$$dX_s = [H X_s + M \alpha_s] ds + \sigma dW_s, \ s \in [t, T],\ X_t = x$$
Our aim is to minimize
dXs =[HXs +Mαs]ds+σdWs,s∈[t,T],Xt =x. α t,x󰀗󰁝T⊤ ⊤ ⊤󰀘
(1)
J (t,x):=E (Xs CXs +α Dαs)ds+XT RXT t
,
where4 C ≥ 0, R ≥ 0 and D > 0, are given and deterministic and we will assume 2×2.
