**Linear quadratic regulator** <br />
We consider
$$dY_t^\lambda=-h\left(Y_{k_\lambda\left(t\right)}^\lambda\right)dt+\sqrt{\frac{2}{\beta}}dW_t$$
$$dX_s = [H X_s + m \alpha_s] ds$$
Our aim is to minimize
dXs =[HXs +Mαs]ds+σdWs,s∈[t,T],Xt =x. α t,x󰀗󰁝T⊤ ⊤ ⊤󰀘
(1)
J (t,x):=E (Xs CXs +α Dαs)ds+XT RXT t
,
where4 C ≥ 0, R ≥ 0 and D > 0, are given and deterministic and we will assume 2×2.
